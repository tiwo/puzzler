I was honoured to be invited to the `10th Gathering for Gardner
<http://g4g10.com>`_, a biennial conference for recreational
mathematics, magic, puzzles, and philosophy, which took place from
March 28 to April 1, 2012.  I gave a talk entitled “Polyform Puzzler,
New Polyforms, and Recent Results” (which I will soon publish here), a
whirlwind introduction to this project, two new polyforms, and some
new puzzles designed specially for this event.  The theme of the event
was “10” and “X”, so I designed X-shaped puzzles for each of the
polyform families supported by Polyform Puzzler.
