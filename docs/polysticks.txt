Tetrasticks
===========

One-Sided Welded Tetrasticks
----------------------------

The "welded" tetrasticks are those that contain junction points, or
welds, and therefore do not form simple connected paths (in other
words, they branch).  There are 6 welded tetrasticks, 4 of which are
asymmetrical, therefore there are 10 one-sided welded tetrasticks.

15 of 16 Tetrasticks
--------------------

Due to an imbalance in horizontal/vertical parity, the 16 tetrasticks
cannot be formed into a symmetrical shape.  But by omitting one of the
five tetrasticks that have an excess of vertical or horizontal line
segments (H, J, L, N, Y), symmetrical shapes can be formed.

  In this solution, the "H" piece is omitted.


One-Sided Tetrasticks
---------------------

9 of the 16 tetrasticks are asymmetrical, therefore there are 25
one-sided tetrasticks.

* 5x5 diamond lattice: 107 solutions (none calculated yet though)

  All 107 non-isomorphic solutions are listed in "Covering the Aztec
  Diamond with One-sided Tetrasticks, Extended Version", by `Alfred
  Wassermann`_, University of Bayreuth.  The solution above is number
  9 in Wassermann's paper.  (Wassermann, and Knuth before him,
  mistakenly called the shape an "aztec diamond", but an `aztec
  diamond is a subtly different shape`__.  This puzzle actually
  corresponds to a `centered square number`__.)

tetrasticks.
