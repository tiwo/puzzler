During a visit to India in 2010, it was pointed out to me that
polystick puzzles look a lot like some of `the "kolam" sand/chalk
drawings`__ that can be seen on sidewalks and patios outside of homes.
These drawings are thought to bestow prosperity to homes.

Tetrasticks
===========

One-Sided Welded Tetrasticks
----------------------------

The "welded" tetrasticks are those that contain junction points, or
welds, and therefore do not form simple connected paths (in other
words, they branch).  There are 6 welded tetrasticks, 4 of which are
asymmetrical, therefore there are 10 one-sided welded tetrasticks.

  <../solutions/one-sided-welded-tetrasticks-5x5.txt>`__

15 of 16 Tetrasticks
--------------------

Due to an imbalance in horizontal/vertical parity, the 16 tetrasticks
cannot be formed into a symmetrical shape.  But by omitting one of the
five tetrasticks that have an excess of vertical or horizontal line
segments (H, J, L, N, Y), symmetrical shapes can be formed.

* 6x6 grid: `1795 solutions
  <../solutions/tetrasticks-6x6.txt>`__

  .. image:: images/tetrasticks-6x6.png

  In this solution, the "H" piece is omitted.


One-Sided Tetrasticks
---------------------

9 of the 16 tetrasticks are asymmetrical, therefore there are 25
one-sided tetrasticks.

* 5x5 diamond lattice: `107 solutions
  <../solutions/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.txt>`__

  .. image:: images/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.png

  Calculating all 107 non-isomorphic solutions took approximately **11
  weeks** using one core of a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 CPU
  (Python 2.6.6, Windows XP) on an otherwise idle and always-on
  machine.  The calculated solutions correspond to those listed in
  `"Covering the Aztec Diamond with One-sided Tetrasticks, Extended
  Version", by Alfred Wassermann, University of Bayreuth`__.
  (Wassermann, and Knuth before him, mistakenly called the shape an
  "aztec diamond", but an `aztec diamond is a subtly different
  shape`__.  This puzzle actually corresponds to a `centered square
  number`__.)

  __ http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CenteredSquareNumber.html

  The solution above is number 9 in Wassermann's paper, and number 58
  in the `Polyform Puzzler solutions`__.  Both Wassermann's and the
  Polyform Puzzler solution sets are split into six sub-puzzles by
  position of the "X" piece, and correspond as follows:

  ================  ==========  =========
  X-Position (sub-puzzle)
  ----------------------------  ---------
  Polyform Puzzler  Wassermann  Solutions
  ================  ==========  =========
  A (symmetrical)   6           19
  B                 5           36
  C (symmetrical)   2           11
  D                 4           19
  E                 1           15
  F                 3           7
  ================  ==========  =========

  __ ../solutions/one-sided-tetrasticks-5x5-diamond-lattice.txt

  Note: The Polyform Puzzler order for the X-positions is in
  increasing distance from the center of the puzzle.  Wassermann's
  order is as follows: with all X-piece possitions in the upper-left
  quadrant in two horizontal rows (rotate the diagrams in the paper
  90Â° clockwise), ordered from left to right, top to bottom.
  Symmetrical X-positions (X-piece on the diagonal) have the I-piece
  limited to horizontal for both Polyform Puzzler and Wassermann (when
  rotated as noted above).

tetrasticks.
