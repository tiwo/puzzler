**Polytrigs** are polyforms constructed from unit line segments (edges)
joined end-to-end on a regular triangular grid, also known as
"triangular-grid polysticks" or "triangular polysticks".

Here is a puzzle containing all the polytrigs of order 1 through 3:

.. image:: images/polytrigs-123-trapezoid-5x4.png

See `Polytrigs: Puzzles & Solutions`_ for many more puzzles.

The name "trig" comes from "TRIangular Grid"; a neologism I invented
because "triangular-grid polysticks" is too unwieldy, especially when
combined with order-prefixes (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.;
"triangular-grid tristicks"!?).  I hope the name catches on.

The polytrigs can be thought of as the projective duals of polyhexes.
Most of the polytrigs of order N can be derived from the polyhexes of
order N+1 (i.e., joining the centers of the hexagons of a tetrahex
results in a tritrig).  The exceptions are the polytrigs with loops
(e.g. the "O04" tetratrig), which are duals of the same order or
lower-order polyhexes.

Hopefully these puzzles will begin to fill this particular gap in the
polyform puzzle branch of recreational mathematics.


Prior Research
==============

    If the square polysticks don't get the respect they deserve, this
    is doubly true for the triangular polysticks.

    -- Alexandre Owen Muñiz, `Puzzle Zapper Blog
       <http://puzzlezapper.com/blog/2010/12/polysticks-on-a-regular-spanning-subgraph/>`__

Brief mention of triangular-grid polysticks is made on the `Wolfram
Mathworld page on Polysticks`__, in Alexandre Owen Muñiz's blog above,
as well as in Livio Zucca's work (the original site is gone, `but a
mirror exists`__).

In January 2012 I received email from Leslie E. Shader (Ph.D.,
Professor Emeritus, Mathematics, University of Wyoming), who shared
the results of his unpublished work on triangular-grid polysticks from
around 1993.

If you know of any other work on this type of puzzle, please let me
know!


Polyforms
=========

The number and names of the various orders of polytrigs are as follows:

=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
Order  | Polyform  | Free       | One-Sided
       | Name      | Polytrigs  | Polytrigs
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
1      monotrig    1            1
2      ditrigs     3            3
3      tritrigs    12           19
4*     tetratrigs  60           104
5*     pentatrigs  375          719
6*     hexatrigs   2613         5123
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========

"*" above means that forms with enclosed holes exist.

The numbers of polytrigs can also be found in the following sequences
from `The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
<http://oeis.org>`_: A159867_ (free) and A151539_ (one-sided).

.. _A159867: http://oeis.org/A159867
.. _A151539: http://oeis.org/A151539

Examples of the polytrigs from order 1 (monotrig) to order 4
(tetratrigs) are given in the tables below.

The polytrigs are named with a letter-number scheme, like "I1", "C3",
and "R14".  The initial letter is the letter of the alphabet that the
polytrig most closely resembles.  In some cases, that resemblance is
weak, and the letters are arbitrary.  The final digit of the number
represents the polyform order (how many line segments are in the
polytrig).  There are more tetratrigs than letters in the alphabet, so
their names have an extra middle digit (numbered from 0) to
differentiate the variations.

In the tables below, "Aspects" refers to the number of unique
orientations that a polyform may take (different rotations, flipped or
not).  This varies with the symmetry of the polyform.

The "One-Sided" column identifies polyforms that are asymmetrical in
reflection.  Treating the flipped and unflipped versions of
asymmetrical polytrigs as distinct polyforms (and disallowing further
reflection or "flipping"), results in "one-sided" polytrigs and
puzzles.

Coordinate System
=================

Polytrig puzzles use a pseudo-3D skewed coordinate system, where the X
and Y axes are 60° apart instead of the usual 90°.  The typical
representation (as seen in the Polyform Puzzler solution data files)
positions the X axis horizontally with the Y axis 30° clockwise from
vertical.

The (X,Y) 2-dimensional coordinate identifies the lower-left corner of
the (X,Y,0) triangle in a polyiamond grid.  The first three line
segments emanating from this point share the (X,Y) coordinate, and the
Z dimension is used for the direction of the line segment:

| z = 0: 0° horizontal, to the right;
| z = 1: 60° counter-clockwise, up and to the right;
| z = 2: 120° counter-clockwise, up and to the left.


Intersections
-------------

As there is the possibility for polytrigs to cross each other at any
(X,Y) intersection, the solution algorithm needs to prevent such
crossings.  Unlike with polysticks, the intersections are not simple
(either used or available); multiple polyforms can use an intersection
simultaneously.

In the puzzle matrix, we represent contstraints on intersections via
up to 6 additional columns per intersection [*]_, in the form i(X,Y,Z)
(or "X,Y,Zi").  This means that the segment in direction Z cannot go
through the intersection, (X,Y).  These are the Z directions::

      2    1
       \  /
    3___\/___0
        /\
       /  \
      4    5

.. [*] Possibly fewer columns for intersections at the edge of a
   puzzle shape.  This represents a possible future optimization.

   Note that since there are already 3 line segments originating at
   each intersection, the cost of intersection constraints is 2 per
   segment, which effectively multiplies the number of coordinate
   columns by 3.  Polytrig puzzle matrixes 

These intersection constraints are secondary columns, meaning that at
most one polyform may use or fill a column.  Unlike primary columns,
secondary columns may remain unused/unfilled.

For each polyform, we check the angle between each pair of line
segments.  Both ends of each segment must be checked, but only in one
direction (counter-clockwise) to avoid duplication.  For any two line
segments, there are six possibilities::

      B  / A
    ____/___     D ____    E ____    F ____
                  /          \
        C        /  D'        \

* A: 60° (adjacent) -- no constraints are added.

* B: 120° (one-gapper) -- 3 constraints are added: the 2 line segments
  themselves (e.g. Z={1,3}), plus the gap in-between (e.g. Z=2).

* C: 180° (two-gapper) -- 4 constraints are added: the 2 line segments
  (e.g. Z={3,0}), plus the two gaps (e.g. Z={4,5}).  Note that the
  gaps on the opposite side will be added when the other line segment
  is checked.

* D: 240° (three-gapper) -- no constraints are added.  However, D' is
  a case of a 120° one-gapper (case B).

* E: 300° (four-gapper) -- no constraints are added.

* F: 360° (five-gapper or stub; only one segment involved) -- no
  constraints are added.

Only cases B & C require constraints.

If an intersection constraint is already used (or otherwise
unavailable), no other polyform with the same contstraint may be
placed in the puzzle solution.
