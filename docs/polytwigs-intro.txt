**Polytwigs** are polyforms constructed from unit line segments
(edges) joined end-to-end on a regular hexagonal grid.  Unit line
segments on a square grid are called "polysticks", so polytwigs could
also be called "polysticks on a hexagonal grid" or "hexagonal-grid
polysticks" or "hexagonal polysticks".  The polytwigs are a subset of
the polytrigs (triangular-grid polysticks); polytwigs would fit on a
polytrig grid, but there are a lot fewer of them.

Here is a puzzle containing all the polytwigs of order 1 through 5:

And here is a puzzle containing all the hexatwigs (order 6):

See `Polytwigs: Puzzles & Solutions`_ for many more puzzles.

Most of the polytwigs of order N can be thought of as the projective
duals of the polyiamonds of order N+1 (i.e., joining the centers of
the triangles of a hexiamond results in a pentatwig).  The exceptions
are the polytwigs with loops (e.g. the "O06" hexatwig), which are
duals of the same order or lower-order polyiamonds.

I believe I am the first to explore this type of puzzle (if not,
please let me know!).

I invented the name "polytwigs" because "hexagonal-grid polysticks" is
too unwieldy, especially when combined with order-prefixes (mono-,
di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.; "hexagonal-grid tristicks"!?).  The name
comes from "twig" being a small stick, often bent and branching.
"Polytwig" is also similar to "polytrig", the name I invented for
triangular-grid polytsicks.  I hope these names catch on.


Polyforms
=========

The number and names of the various orders of polytwigs are as follows:

=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
Order  | Polyform  | Free       | One-Sided
       | Name      | Polytwigs  | Polytwigs
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========
1      monotwig    1            1
2      ditwig      1            1
3      tritwigs    3            4
4      tetratwigs  4            6
5      pentatwigs  12           19
6      hexatwigs   27           49
7      heptatwigs  78           143
=====  ==========  ===========  ===========

The numbers of polytwigs can also be found in the following sequences
from `The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
<http://oeis.org>`_: A197459_ (free) and A197460_ (one-sided).

.. _A197459: http://oeis.org/A197459
.. _A197460: http://oeis.org/A197460

Examples of the polytwigs from order 1 (monotwig) to order 6
(hexatwigs) are given in the tables below.

The polytwigs are named with a letter-number scheme, like "I1", "C3",
and "R16".  The letter part is the letter of the alphabet that the
polytwig most closely resembles.  In some cases, that resemblance is
weak, and the letters are arbitrary.  The final digit of the number
represents the polyform order (how many line segments are in the
polytwig).  There are more hexatwigs than letters in the alphabet, so
their names have an extra middle digit (numbered from 0) to
differentiate the variations.

In the tables below, "Aspects" refers to the number of unique
orientations that a polyform may take (different rotations, flipped or
not).  This varies with the symmetry of the polyform.

The "One-Sided" column identifies polyforms that are asymmetrical in
reflection.  Treating the flipped and unflipped versions of
asymmetrical polytwigs as distinct polyforms (and disallowing further
reflection or "flipping"), results in "one-sided" polytwigs and
puzzles.

Coordinate System
=================

Polytwig puzzles use a pseudo-3D skewed coordinate system, where the X
and Y axes are 60째 apart instead of the usual 90째.  The typical
representation (as seen in the Polyform Puzzler solution data files)
positions the Y axis vertically with the X axis 30째 counter-clockwise
from horizontal.  Solution graphics are often rotated so the X axis is
horizontal, and the Y axis 30째 clockwise from vertical.

The (X,Y) 2-dimensional coordinate identifies the lower-left corner of
the (X,Y) hexagon in a polyhex grid (a honeycomb with hexagons with
horizontal tops & bottoms).  The three line segments emanating from
this point share the (X,Y) coordinate, and the Z dimension is used for
the direction of the line segment:

| z = 0: 0째 horizontal, to the right;
| z = 1: 120째 counter-clockwise, up and to the left;
| z = 2: 240째 counter-clockwise, down and to the left.

Since only three line segments may emanate from each (X,Y)
intersection, there is no possibility for polytwigs to cross each
other and no need to keep track of intersections.  This separates
polytwigs from polysticks and polytrigs, where such considerations are
crucial.
