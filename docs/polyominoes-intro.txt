**Polyominoes** are polyforms constructed from unit squares joined
edge-to-edge on a regular two-dimensional Cartesian plane.  The name
comes from dominoes; one domino is composed of two ("d-", short for
"di-") unit squares ("-omino").

Here is a puzzle containing all the polyominoes of order 1 through 5:

See `Polyominoes: Puzzles & Solutions`_ and `Pentominoes: Puzzles &
Solutions`_ for many more puzzles.

Polyominoes were named and studied by Solomon Golomb and popularized
by Martin Gardner in `Scientific American` magazine in the 1950's.
Pentominoes may have been first featured in a puzzle in 1907
(Dudeney's `The Canterbury Puzzles`), although the history of
polyforms may go back much further.  The tetrominoes are well known
from the video game "Tetris".

`Kadon Enterprises`__, vendors of quality polyform puzzles in wood and
acrylic, have `an excellent introduction to polyominoes on their
site`__.

When the polyominoes are formed from unit cubes intead of flat
squares, they are called "solid polyominoes" or "planar polycubes".
See `An Introduction to Polycubes <polycubes-intro.html>`_ for
background, and `Polyominoes: Puzzles & Solutions`_ for many puzzles.


Polyforms
=========

The number and names of the various orders of polyominoes are as
follows:

=====  ===========  =============  =============
Order  | Polyform   | Free         | One-Sided
       | Name       | Polyominoes  | Polyominoes
=====  ===========  =============  =============
1      monomino     1              1
2      domino       1              1
3      trominoes    2              2
4      tetrominoes  5              7
5      pentominoes  12             18
6      hexominoes   35             60
=====  ===========  =============  =============

The numbers of polyominoes can also be found in the following sequences
from `The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
<http://oeis.org>`_: A000105_ (free) and A000988_ (one-sided).

.. _A000105: http://oeis.org/A000105
.. _A000988: http://oeis.org/A000988

Examples of the polyominoes from order 1 (monomino) to order 5
(pentominoes) are given in the tables below.

The polyominoes are named with letters (like the pentomino "X") or a
letter-number scheme (like the "I3" tromino).  The traditional names
for the pentominoes are used by Polyform Puzzler, without a number
suffix.  The rest of the polyomino names correspond loosely to Kadon's
names for their `Poly-4 Supplement`_ set (exceptions noted in the
tables below).  Kadon also has `a naming system for hexominoes`__ (not
covered here).

__ http://www.gamepuzzles.com/sxnames.htm

The initial letter of each name is the letter of the alphabet that the
polyomino most closely resembles, or an initial.  In some cases, that
resemblance is weak, and the letters are arbitrary.  The final digit
of the number represents the polyform order (how many unit squares are
in the polyomino).

.. _table legend:

In the tables below, "Aspects" refers to the number of unique
orientations that a polyform may take (different rotations, flipped or
not).  This varies with the symmetry of the polyform.

The "One-Sided" column identifies polyforms that are asymmetrical in
reflection.  Treating the flipped and unflipped versions of
asymmetrical polyominoes as distinct polyforms (and disallowing
further reflection or "flipping"), results in "one-sided" polyominoes
and puzzles.

Alternate names and name origins are noted in the "Name" column.

Coordinate System
=================

Polyominoes use a standard 2-dimensional *(x,y)* Cartesian coordinate
system.

Each unit square has 4 immediate neighbors.  The neighbors of the
square at coordinates *(x, y)* are:

    *{(x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1)}*
