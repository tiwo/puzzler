The Project
===========

What is "Polyform Puzzler"?
---------------------------

Polyform Puzzler is a set of solvers for many polyform puzzles (like
Pentominoes and Soma Cubes), and a software toolkit for exploring &
solving polyform puzzles.  It consists of a set of front-end
applications for specific polyform puzzles and a Python library that
does the heavy lifting.  New polyforms and new puzzles can easily be
defined and added to the core.


How did Polyform Puzzler begin?
-------------------------------

I first discovered Pentominoes in Arthur C. Clarke's novel `Imperial
Earth`, probably around the time I was 11 or 12 years old.  I picked
up a pentominoes puzzle ("Hexed", by Gabriel Toys) at a local hobby
store and spent many hours discovering solutions.

In university, probably while avoiding legitimate study, I wrote the
first implementation of a Pentominoes-solving project, in Object
Pascal.  I developed an algorithm that solved the puzzle using brute
force with some intelligence applied:

* Place each pentomino in every possible location.
* Confirm that the remaining empty spaces all have areas that are a
  multiple of 5 squares.
* For areas of exactly 5 squares, determine the piece that fits and
  confirm its availability.
* Check for bottlenecks that force a subset of the remaining space to
  accept only a single specific piece, and confirm its availability.

When I first learned Python_, I reimplemented this as a practical
learning exercise.  I improved the algorithm a bit and got it to work
pretty well, if not completely bug-free.  It was a fun and interesting
exercise, but the code was complicated and ran slow.  (It didn't help
that I only had a 66MHz computer at the time.)

I even went so far as to register the "puzzler" project on
SourceForge, but didn't take it any further at that time.  I had
scratched my itch enough, and another itch became more persistent...

While writing the second implementation and learning Python I
discovered Python docstrings and started looking around for
auto-documentation systems to exploit them.  I couldn't find anything
that worked well for me, so I started scratching *that* itch, and
eventually reStructuredText_ & Docutils_ were born.  You could say
that Polyform Puzzler spawned Docutils_.

In the summer of 2006 I discovered a new approach for solving polyform
puzzles, Donald Knuth's "Dancing Links Algorithm X" ("DLX") approach
to the "exact cover" problem, `described below`__.  This approach was
so different from what I'd done previously, and so obviously superior,
that my old itch resurfaced.  Polyform Puzzler is the result.

Most definitely, yes!  See the next question for how.


How can others contribute?
--------------------------

**Python programmers**
    Please jump right in, there's a lot `to do`_!  Patches are
    welcome, as are new project members (see the next question).

**Programmers who don't know Python**
    Have you considered learning Python_?  It's a great language,
    focused on programmer productivity.  Python excels at the rapid
    creation of maintainable code.  It's scalable.  And it's fun.
    `Give it a try!`__

    __ http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers

    There is one area where Python doesn't shine: raw speed.  But that
    can be solved with extension modules written in C.  The workhorse
    of the Polyform Puzzler project, the puzzler.exact_cover_ module,
    should be rewritten as an extension module in C for speed.  See
    section 4, `The Code`_, for an introduction.

**Non-programmers**
    Have you considered learning to program?  It's not as difficult as
    you think, and it can be loads of fun!  Here are some `guides for
    beginners to get you started`__.

Polyforms
=========

What are "Polyforms"?
---------------------

The word "polyform" can be defined from its parts:

    poly-
        more than one; many
    form
        shape

According to the `Wikipedia definition`_,

    a polyform is a plane figure constructed by joining together
    identical basic polygons

`Regular polygons`_ which `tile the plane`_ (fill, without gaps or
overlap; a tessellation_) are the most satisfying basic polygons for
polyform puzzles, and there are three: the equilateral triangle, the
square, and the hexagon.  Other polygons can be used though.  With a
given polygon, the set of polyforms of order *N* is defined by
constructing all possible combinations of *N* copies of that polygon,
joined edge to edge, without overlapping.  Duplicates (from rotation
or reflection) are typically ignored, although some puzzles explicitly
treat reflections separately ("one-sided").

For example, 5 squares can be combined in 12 different ways, resulting
in the "pentominoes":

.. figure:: images/pentominoes.png

   The 12 pentominoes, with their common names.

Many sets of polyforms can combine to fill certain areas or volumes.
These can be called "polyform puzzles" or "combinatoric dissection
puzzles".  For example, the pentominoes can fill a 6x10 rectangle:

.. figure:: images/pentominoes6x10.png

   One 6 |x| 10 pentominoes solution.

There are 2339 distinct ways to fit the pentominoes into a 6x10
rectangle.  Polyform Puzzler `can find them all`_.

The definition of polyforms above can be generalized to include solids
(polyhedra) joined face to face.  `Regular (Platonic) solids`_ that
`fill space`_ are the most satisfying, but there is only one Platonic
solid that fills space: the cube.  Tetrahedra and octahedra together
can fill space though.  In addition, the `truncated octahedron`_ (a
`semi-regular, Archimedian solid`_) and the `rhombic dodecahedron`_
can each individually fill space, as can other, less regular
polyhedra.

The polyform definition can also be extended to include other forms,
like line segments of a grid (polysticks).  The sky's the limit!

What polyforms are there?
-------------------------

There are many possible families of polyforms, with new ones being
invented all the time.  Polyform Puzzler only deals with a limited
number of polyforms; in my opinion the most aesthetically pleasing
ones.  Polyform families are given descriptive names:

* Square-based polyforms are named "polyominoes_" (from a "domino",
  which is two squares joined): monomino, domino, tromino, tetromino,
  pentomino, hexomino, etc.

  The tetrominoes are famous for their role in the videogame "Tetris".
  The 12 pentominoes are probably the most well-known polyform, due to
  their versatility and the large variety of non-trivial puzzles they
  form.

  .. figure:: images/pentominoes-3x20.png

     3 |x| 20 Pentominoes (2 solutions; can you see the other one?)

  .. figure:: images/one-sided-pentominoes-3x30.png

     3 |x| 30 One-Sided Pentominoes (46 solutions)

* Substituting a 3D cube for each 2D square in polyominoes results in
  "solid polyominoes" or "planar polycubes".  

  .. figure:: images/solid-pentominoes-3x4x5.png

     3 |x| 4 |x| 5 Solid Pentominoes (3940 solutions)

* Polyforms based on cubes extending into 3 (or more!) dimensions are
  called "polycubes_".  The polycubes that are flat (only one cube
  thick) are known as "planar polycubes" or "solid polyominoes".

  .. figure:: images/tetracubes-2x2x8.png

     2 |x| 2 |x| 8 tetracubes (224 solutions)

  `Soma Cubes`_ are a well-known group of 7 polycubes (6 tetracubes
  and 1 tricube): all the non-convex (non-box-like) 3-dimensional
  polycubes up to order 4 (because with 5 cubes, we'd need 4
  dimensions!).

  .. figure:: images/soma-3x3x3.png

     3 |x| 3 |x| 3 Soma Cubes (240 solutions)

  ..  _Soma cubes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube

* Polyforms based on equilateral triangles are named "polyiamonds_"
  (from the "diamond", which is two triangles joined).

  .. figure:: images/hexiamonds-4x10-long-hex.png

     4 |x| 10 Hexiamond Elongated Hexagon (856 solutions)

* Polyforms based on regular hexagons are named "polyhexes_" (there's
  no clever etymology here).

  .. figure:: images/tetrahex-coin.png

     5 |x| 7 Tetrahex "Coin" (4 solutions)

* Polyforms based on unit line segments joined end-to-end on a square
  grid are called "polysticks" [#polysticks]_ (a.k.a. "polyedges" or
  "polypleura_").  The shapes formed from matchsticks joined together
  end-to-end at 90° angles are polysticks.  Polysticks are related to
  polyominoes: polysticks can be thought of as paths joining the
  centers of the squares of polyominoes.

Where can I find physical polyform puzzles?
-------------------------------------------

For a wide variety via mail order, I **highly recommend** `Kadon
Enterprises`_ (see my `wish list`_).

I also recommend doing research on the web, then checking out your
local toy, game, and puzzle specialty stores.  If they don't stock
what you want, ask them to get it for you!  Here are some sources that
I know of:

* The 21 polyominoes of order 1-5 are used as the playing pieces in
  the "Blokus_" board game.

* Solid pentominoes are commonly available in the "Pocket Play" series
  by `Shoptaugh Games`_ (distributed in Canada and elsewhere by
  `Family Games`_).

* Soma Cubes are sold under the name "Block By Block" by ThinkFun_.

* The 22 polyiamonds of order 1-6 are used as the playing pieces in
  the "Blokus Trigon" board game. 

* In Japan, many polyform puzzles are available from Tenyo_.

How should the solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------

The `solution files <http://puzzler.sourceforge.net/solutions>`__ are
text files that all follow a common pattern.  The first line states
the puzzle matrix class (from the puzzler.puzzles module) being
solved::

    Solving Pentominoes6x10Matrix:

Some puzzles are split up into several matrices.  After all the
solutions for one matrix are exhausted, the name of the next matrix
will be given.

Each solution record contains three parts.  First, the solution header
with the solution number::

    solution 1:

The second part of the solution record lists the solution coordinates,
one piece per line, with the piece name last::

    1,1 2,0 2,1 2,2 3,1 X
    0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 1,0 L
    3,0 4,0 4,1 4,2 5,1 F
    5,0 6,0 6,1 6,2 7,0 T
    1,2 1,3 2,3 3,2 3,3 U
    0,4 0,5 1,4 1,5 2,4 P
    2,5 3,5 4,5 5,5 6,5 I
    5,2 5,3 6,3 7,3 7,4 Z
    3,4 4,3 4,4 5,4 6,4 Y
    7,5 8,5 9,3 9,4 9,5 V
    7,1 7,2 8,0 8,1 9,0 W
    8,2 8,3 8,4 9,1 9,2 N

In some puzzles, like the 6x6 tetrasticks, one or more pieces are
omitted from each solution.  Such omitted pieces are listed with "!"
in place of the coordinates list::

    ! H

If there are omitted pieces, a notice is prefixed to the visual
representation::

    (H omitted)

The third part of the solution record is a visual representation of
the solution::

    P P I I I I I V V V
    P P P Y Y Y Y Z N V
    L U U U Y Z Z Z N V
    L U X U F Z T W N N
    L X X X F F T W W N
    L L X F F T T T W W

Finally, the number of solutions, the number of searches (software
operations executed), and the duration (time taken to complete the
execution) are listed::

    2339 solutions, 906813 searches, duration 0:19:10.133000


How should polyomino solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------------

Polyominoes use a 2-dimensional X,Y cartesian coordinate system.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in a 2-D
grid.  Imagine each letter as a square, with adjacent like-labelled
squares joined::

    N Z I I I I I U U U
    N Z Z Z P P P U W U
    N N T Z X P P W W L
    V N T X X X W W F L
    V T T T X Y F F F L
    V V V Y Y Y Y F L L


How should polycube solution files be interpreted?
--------------------------------------------------

Polycubes (solid pentominoes, Soma cubes) use a 3-dimensional X,Y,Z
cartesian coordinate system.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in
multiple layers, each a 2-D slice of a 3-D space.  Imagine the layers
stacked up from left to right, with each letter as a cube, with
adjacent like-labelled cubes joined::

    U V V V N    U W T T T    U W Z L Y
    U W Z V N    X W Z T Y    U F Z L Y
    X W Z V N    X P P T N    X F F L Y
    I I I I I    X P P P N    F F L L Y

Some polycube puzzles, like the solid pentomino ring puzzles, are
equivalent to a 2-dimensional puzzle folded into 3 dimensions.  These
puzzles' visual representations consist of the view from each side of
the solution, with corners duplicated between adjacent sides::

    U U V    V Z Y Y Y Y W T F    F L L    U X P P P L L L L
    X U V    V Z Z Z Y W W T F    F F F    X X X P P N N N F
    U U V    V V V Z W W T T T    T F N    U X I I I I I N N

In the solution to the 3x3x9 solid pentomino ring puzzle above, the
left wall is shown first, then the front wall, then the right wall,
then the back wall.  The back wall is shown with the same orientation
as the front wall.


How should polyhex solution files be interpreted?
-------------------------------------------------

Polyhexes use a 2-dimensional X,Y, skewed cartesian coordinate system.
The X and Y axes are 60° apart instead of 90°.

How should polyiamond solution files be interpreted?
----------------------------------------------------

Polyiamonds use a pseudo-3-dimensional X,Y,Z, skewed cartesian
coordinate system.  The X and Y axes are 60° apart instead of 90°, and
the Z dimension is used to represent the orientation of triangles::

               ____
        /\     \  /
    z=0/__\  z=1\/

The visual representation is an ASCII-art drawing of the solution,
with the X-axis horizontal and the Y-axis sloping to the right::

            ____________________________________
           /   /           /    \      /       /
          /   /___________/   ___\    /       /
         /       /    \      /   /    \  /\  /

      /   ____/  \____/   /  \_______\    /
     /   /        \       \          /   /
    /___/__________\_______\________/___/


How should polystick solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------------

Polysticks use a pseudo-3-dimensional X,Y,Z cartesian coordinate
system, but the line segments of the grid are significant, not the
squares.  The Z dimension is used to represent the direction of line
segments: 0=horizontal, 1=vertical.  Horizontal line segments "x,y,0"
start at (x,y) and end at (x+1,y), one unit to the right.  Vertical
line segments "x,y,1" start at (x,y) and end at (x,y+1), one unit up.
(The Z dimension corresponds to the index of the dimension that
increases.)  Internal intersections (where grid lines cross) are also
shown, in the form "x,yi", but these can be ignored.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in an
ASCII-art drawing of the 2-D grid.  Imagine each line segment with
adjacent like-labelled segments joined::

     -R-- -T-- -T-- -R*-
    Y    R    T    R    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -Y*- -R-- -R*- -Y--
    Y    R    T    R    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -H-- -H-- -H*- -H*-
    Y    H    X    H    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -H-- -X-- -X-- -H*-
    F    F    X    F    F
    |    |    |    *    *
     -F-- -F-- -F*- -F*-

How are the polyform puzzles solved?
------------------------------------

Polyform Puzzler works by reducing puzzles into "`exact cover`_"
problems.  Briefly, to solve an exact cover problem, given a matrix of
0s and 1s, we must find a set of rows which, when combined, contain
exactly one 1 in each column.  To find every solution we must find all
such sets of rows.

We construct a two-dimensional matrix with named columns.  The column
names consist of the puzzle piece names, then the coordinates of the
solution space.  For example, in a puzzle with three pieces to be
placed in a 3x3 grid, we'd have 12 columns::

    A  B  C    0,0  1,0  2,0    0,1  1,1  2,1    0,2  1,2  2,2

We determine every possible position of each puzzle piece in the
puzzle, and construct one row for each position.  Starting with a row
of 0s, put a 1 in the column for the puzzle piece name and in each
column corresponding to the position of the puzzle piece.  For
example, puzzle piece A covering coordinates (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1)
would create this row in the matrix::

    1  0  0    1  0  0    1  1  0    0  0  0

Once all the rows have been constructed (there may be many), the
solutions can be found by identifying sets of rows that, combined,
have exactly one 1 in each column.  For example, this is one such
solution::

    1  0  0    1  0  0    1  1  0    0  0  0
    0  1  0    0  1  1    0  0  1    0  0  0
    0  0  1    0  0  0    0  0  0    1  1  1

The puzzler.exact_cover_ module implements Donald E. Knuth's `Dancing
Links`_ approach to his `Algorithm X`_ ("DLX").  For a complete
description of DLX, see Knuth's paper (`compressed PostScript
original`__ or `PDF version`__).

How are Sudoku puzzles solved?
------------------------------

Sudoku can be reduced to the same kind of `exact cover`_ problem as
polyform puzzles, and the same DLX algorithm can be used to solve
Sudoku puzzles.  It's just a matter of identifying the constraints.

Here's a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle we'll use to illustrate::

    1 . | . 4
    . 4 | . 2
    ----+----
    2 3 | . 1
    . . | 2 .

Each row, column, and block must contain the digits (1, 2, 3, 4)
exactly once.  We have four sets of constraints:

1. There are 4 blocks, numbered 0, 1, 2, & 3.  Each block must contain
   the digits (1, 2, 3, 4) exactly once.  We can name each exact cover
   matrix column with the combination of digit value and block number::

       1b0 2b0 3b0 4b0 1b1 2b1 3b1 4b1 1b2 2b2 3b2 4b2 1b3 2b3 3b3 4b3

   Each name is of the form: digit + "b" + block number.  There are
   sixteen combinations, 4 * 4, or 4-squared.  In a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle,
   there will be 81 combinations.

2. There are 4 columns, again numbered 0, 1, 2, & 3.  Each column must
   contain each digit exactly once.  Again, we combine the digit
   values and column numbers to name exact cover matrix columns::

       1c0 2c0 3c0 4c0 1c1 2c1 3c1 4c1 1c2 2c2 3c2 4c2 1c3 2c3 3c3 4c3

   Each name is of the form: digit + "c" + column number.  There are
   16 combinations, (4 * 4, or 4-squared).  In a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle,
   there will be 81 combinations.

3. Similarly for the 4 rows::

       1r0 2r0 3r0 4r0 1r1 2r1 3r1 4r1 1r2 2r2 3r2 4r2 1r3 2r3 3r3 4r3

4. We must also make sure that no digit is placed in the same location
   more than once.  So we have constraints on all coordinate pairs,
   all combinations of rows & columns::

       0,0 1,0 2,0 3,0 0,1 1,1 2,1 3,1 0,2 1,2 2,2 3,2 0,3 1,3 2,3 3,3
   
Altogether there are 4 sets of constraints, each with 16 (4 * 4)
elements, for a total of 64 columns in the exact cover matrix.  For a
9x9 puzzle, we will have 4 times (9 squared) = 324 columns.

A Sudoku puzzle has a starting position, a set of given digits in a
sparse grid.  The program creates one exact cover matrix row for each
of these digits.  Each row will have exactly four "1" values, one each
for the block, the column, and the row (each paired with the digit
value), and one for the column & row coordinate pair.  The program
will then generates one candidate row for each digit in each empty
square in the starting position.

The resulting matrix is then fed into the DLX algorithm, which
produces the result: a set of rows that satisfies all constraints.  If
the puzzle is ambiguous (and therefore not well-formed), more than one
result may be produced.  If an entirely empty starting position is
used, the algorithm will eventually produce every possible Sudoku
solution (all 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 of them, if you give it
enough time).
