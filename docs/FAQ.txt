The Project
===========

What is "Polyform Puzzler"?
---------------------------

Polyform Puzzler is a software toolkit for exploring & solving
polyform puzzles (like Pentominoes and Soma Cubes).  It consists of a
set of front-end applications for specific polyform puzzles and a
Python library that does the heavy lifting.  New polyforms and new
puzzles can easily be defined and added to the core.


How did Polyform Puzzler begin?
-------------------------------

I first discovered Pentominoes in Arthur C. Clarke's `Imperial Earth`,
probably around the time I was 11 or 12 years old.  I picked up a
"Hexed" puzzle (by Gabriel Toys) at a local hobby store and spent many
hours solving it.

In university, probably while avoiding legitimate study, I wrote the
first implementation of a Pentominoes-solving project, in Object
Pascal.  I developed an algorithm that solved the puzzle using brute
force with some intelligence applied:

* Place each pentomino in every possible location.
* Check remaining spaces for areas that are a multiple of 5.
* Check for the availability of a piece for areas exactly 5 squares
  large.
* Check for bottlenecks that force a subset of the remaining space to
  accept only a single specific piece, and check for its availability.

When I first learned Python_, I reimplemented this as a practical
learning exercise.  I improved the algorithm a bit and got it to work
pretty well, if not completely bug-free.  It was a fun and interesting
exercise, but the code was complicated and ran slow.  (It didn't help
that I only had a 66MHz computer at the time.)

I even went so far as to register the "puzzler" project on
SourceForge, but didn't take it any further at that time.  I had
scratched my itch enough, and another itch became more persistent...

While writing the second implementation and learning Python I
discovered Python docstrings and started looking around for
auto-documentation systems to exploit them.  I couldn't find anything
that worked well for me, so I started scratching *that* itch, and
eventually reStructuredText_ & Docutils_ were born.  You could say
that Polyform Puzzler spawned Docutils_.

Recently (2006) I discovered a new approach for solving such puzzles,
Donald Knuth's "Dancing Links Algorithm X" ("DLX") approach to the
"exact cover" problem, `described below`__.  This approach was so
different from what I'd done previously, and so obviously superior,
that my old itch resurfaced.  Polyform Puzzler is the result.

Polyforms
=========

What are "Polyforms"?
---------------------

The word "polyform" can be defined by its parts:

    poly-
        more than one; many
    form
        shape

According to the `Wikipedia definition`_,

    a polyform is a plane figure constructed by joining together
    identical basic polygons

`Regular polygons`_ which `tile the plane`_ (fill, without gaps or
overlap; a tessellation_) are the most satisfying basic polygons for
polyform puzzles, and there are three: the equilateral triangle, the
square, and the hexagon.  Other polygons can be used though.  With a
given polygon, the set of polyforms of order *N* is defined by
constructing all possible combinations of *N* copies of that polygon,
joined edge to edge, without overlapping.  Duplicates (from rotation
or reflection) are typically ignored, although some puzzles explicitly
treat reflections separately ("one-sided").

For example, 5 squares can be combined in 12 different ways, resulting
in the "pentominoes":

.. figure:: images/pentominoes.png

   The 12 pentominoes, with their common names.

Many sets of polyforms can be combined to fill certain areas or
volumes.  These can be called "polyform puzzles" or "combinatoric
dissection puzzles".  For example, the pentominoes can fill a 6x10
rectangle:

.. figure:: images/pentominoes6x10.png

   One 6x10 pentominoes solution.

There are 2339 distinct ways to fit the pentominoes into a 6x10
rectangle.  The Polyform Puzzler `can find them all`_.

The definition of polyforms above can be generalized to include solids
(polyhedra) joined face to face.  `Regular (Platonic) solids`_ that
`fill space`_ are the most satisfying, but there is only one Platonic
solid that fills space: the cube.  Tetrahedra and octahedra together
can fill space though.  In addition, the `truncated octahedron`_ (a
`semi-regular, Archimedian solid`_) and the `rhombic dodecahedron`_
can each individually fill space.

The polyform definition can also be extended to include other forms.
The sky's the limit!

What polyforms are there?
-------------------------

There are many possible families of polyforms, with new ones being
invented all the time.  Polyform Puzzler only deals with a limited
number of polyforms; in my opinion the most aesthetically pleasing
ones.  Polyform families are given descriptive names:

* Square-based polyforms are named "polyominoes_" (from a "domino",
  which is two squares joined): monomino, domino, tromino, tetromino,
  pentomino, hexomino, etc.

  The tetrominoes are famous for their role in the videogame "Tetris".
  The 12 pentominoes are probably the most well-known polyform, due to
  their versatility and the large variety of non-trivial puzzles they
  form.  The 21 polyominoes of order 1-5 are used as the playing
  pieces in the "Blokus_" board game.

* Substituting a 3D cube for each 2D square in polyominoes results in
  "solid polyominoes" or "planar polycubes" (see "polycubes" below).

  The 12 solid pentominoes fill a 3x4x5 solid in 3940 distinct
  ways.

* Polyforms based on equilateral triangles are named "polyiamonds_"
  (from the "diamond", which is two triangles joined).  The 22
  polyiamonds of order 1-6 are used as the playing pieces in the
  "Blokus Trigon" board game.

* Polyforms based on regular hexagons are named "polyhexes_" (there's
  no clever etymology here):

* Polyforms based on cubes are called "polycubes_".  The polycubes
  that are flat (only one cube thick) are known as "planar polycubes"
  or "solid polyominoes".

* Polyforms based on unit line segments joined end-to-end on a square
  grid are called "polysticks" [#polysticks]_ (a.k.a. "polyedges" or
  "polypleura_").  The shapes formed from matchsticks joined together
  end-to-end at 90° angles are polysticks.  Polysticks are related to
  polyominoes: polysticks can be thought of as paths joining the
  centers of the squares of polyominoes.

How should the solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------

The `solution files <http://puzzler.sourceforge.net/solutions>`__ all
follow a common pattern.  The first line states the puzzle matrix
class (from the puzzler.puzzles module) being solved::

    Solving Pentominoes6x10Matrix:

Some puzzles are split up into several matrices.  After all the
solutions for one matrix are exhausted, the name of the next matrix
will be stated.

Each solution record contains three parts.  First, the solution header
with the solution number::

    solution 1:

The second part of the solution record lists the solution coordinates,
one piece per line, with the piece name last:

    1,1 2,0 2,1 2,2 3,1 X
    0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 1,0 L
    3,0 4,0 4,1 4,2 5,1 F
    5,0 6,0 6,1 6,2 7,0 T
    1,2 1,3 2,3 3,2 3,3 U
    0,4 0,5 1,4 1,5 2,4 P
    2,5 3,5 4,5 5,5 6,5 I
    5,2 5,3 6,3 7,3 7,4 Z
    3,4 4,3 4,4 5,4 6,4 Y
    7,5 8,5 9,3 9,4 9,5 V
    7,1 7,2 8,0 8,1 9,0 W
    8,2 8,3 8,4 9,1 9,2 N

In some puzzles, like the 5x5 tetrasticks, one or more pieces are
omitted from each solution.  Such omitted pieces are listed with "!"
in place of the coordinates list:

    ! H

If there are omitted pieces, they are prefixed to the visual
representation::

    (H omitted)

The third part of the solution record is a visual representation of
the solution::

    P P I I I I I V V V
    P P P Y Y Y Y Z N V
    L U U U Y Z Z Z N V
    L U X U F Z T W N N
    L X X X F F T W W N
    L L X F F T T T W W

Finally, the number of solutions, the number of searches (software
operations executed), and the duration (time taken to complete the
execution) are listed::

    2339 solutions, 906813 searches, duration 0:19:10.133000


How should polyomino solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------------

Polyominoes use a 2-dimensional X,Y cartesian coordinate system.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in a 2-D
grid.  Imagine each letter as a square, with adjacent like-labelled
squares joined::

    N Z I I I I I U U U
    N Z Z Z P P P U W U
    N N T Z X P P W W L
    V N T X X X W W F L
    V T T T X Y F F F L
    V V V Y Y Y Y F L L


How should polycube solution files be interpreted?
--------------------------------------------------

Polycubes (solid pentominoes, Soma cubes) use a 3-dimensional X,Y,Z
cartesian coordinate system.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in
multiple layers, each a 2-D slice of a 3-D space.  Imagine the layers
stacked up from left to right, with each letter as a cube, with
adjacent like-labelled cubes joined::

    U V V V N    U W T T T    U W Z L Y
    U W Z V N    X W Z T Y    U F Z L Y
    X W Z V N    X P P T N    X F F L Y
    I I I I I    X P P P N    F F L L Y

Some polycube puzzles, like the solid pentomino ring puzzles, are
equivalent to a 2-dimensional puzzle folded into 3 dimensions.  These
puzzles' visual representations consist of the view from each side of
the solution, with corners duplicated between adjacent sides::

    U U V    V Z Y Y Y Y W T F    F L L    U X P P P L L L L
    X U V    V Z Z Z Y W W T F    F F F    X X X P P N N N F
    U U V    V V V Z W W T T T    T F N    U X I I I I I N N

In the solution to the 3x3x9 solid pentomino ring puzzle above, the
left wall is shown first, then the front wall, then the right wall,
then the back wall.  The back wall is shown with the same orientation
as the front wall.


How should polyhex solution files be interpreted?
-------------------------------------------------

Polyhexes use a 2-dimensional X,Y, skewed cartesian coordinate system.
The X and Y axes are 60° apart instead of 90°.

The visual representation is an ASCII-art drawing of the solution,
with the Y-axis vertical and the X-axis sloping up::

                       __

How should polyiamond solution files be interpreted?
----------------------------------------------------

Polyiamonds use a pseudo-3-dimensional X,Y,Z, skewed cartesian
coordinate system.  The X and Y axes are 60° apart instead of 90°, and
the Z dimension is used to represent the orientation of triangles::

               ____
        /\     \  /
    z=0/__\  z=1\/

The visual representation is an ASCII-art drawing of the solution,
with the X-axis horizontal and the Y-axis sloping to the right::

How should polystick solution files be interpreted?
---------------------------------------------------

Polysticks use a 2-dimensional X,Y cartesian coordinate system, but
the lines of the grid are significant, not the squares.  The solution
coordinates consist of individual line segments in the form "x,yh" and
"x,yv".  Horizontal line segments "x,yh" start at (x,y) and end at
(x+1,y), one unit to the right.  Vertical line segments "x,yv" start
at (x,y) and end at (x,y+1), one unit up.  Internal intersections
(where grid lines cross) are also shown, in the form "x,yi", but can
be ignored.

The visual representation consists of piece names (letters) in an
ASCII-art drawing of the 2-D grid.  Imagine each line segment with
adjacent like-labelled segments joined::

     -R-- -T-- -T-- -R*-
    Y    R    T    R    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -Y*- -R-- -R*- -Y--
    Y    R    T    R    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -H-- -H-- -H*- -H*-
    Y    H    X    H    Y
    *    |    |    *    |
     -H-- -X-- -X-- -H*-
    F    F    X    F    F
    |    |    |    *    *
     -F-- -F-- -F*- -F*-

The solution above is from the 4x4 welded one-sided tetrasticks
puzzle.  Asterisks ("*") indicate flipped pieces.

How are the polyform puzzles solved?
------------------------------------

Polyform Puzzler works by reducing puzzles into "`exact cover`_"
problems.  Briefly, to solve an exact cover problem, given a matrix of
0s and 1s, we must find a set of rows which, when combined, contain
exactly one 1 in each column.  To find every solution we must find all
such sets of rows.

We construct a two-dimensional matrix with named columns.  The column
names consist of the puzzle piece names, then the coordinates of the
solution space.  For example, in a puzzle with three pieces to be
placed in a 3x3 grid, we'd have 12 columns::

    A  B  C    0,0  1,0  2,0    0,1  1,1  2,1    0,2  1,2  2,2

We determine every possible position of each puzzle piece in the
puzzle, and construct one row for each position.  Starting with a row
of 0s, put a 1 in the column for the puzzle piece name and in each
column corresponding to the position of the puzzle piece.  For
example, puzzle piece A covering coordinates (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1)
would create this row in the matrix::

    1  0  0    1  0  0    1  1  0    0  0  0

Once all the rows have been constructed (there may be many), the
solutions can be found by identifying sets of rows that, combined,
have exactly one 1 in each column.  For example, this is one such
solution::

    1  0  0    1  0  0    1  1  0    0  0  0
    0  1  0    0  1  1    0  0  1    0  0  0
    0  0  1    0  0  0    0  0  0    1  1  1

The puzzler.exact_cover_ module implements Donald E. Knuth's `Dancing
Links`_ approach to his `Algorithm X`_ ("DLX").  For a complete
description of DLX, see Knuth's paper (`compressed PostScript
original`__ or `PDF version`__).
